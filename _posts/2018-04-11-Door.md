## Intro:
It was the first “project” I have done in this shed and it was a beginning of the huge adventure. The problem and solution might look silly, but it lead to a series of other related projects and big variety of solutions to it.

## Time: 
October-November 2015
## Situation: 
The door handle in a shed was broken. When I first decided to set an office in that shed, I obviously needed that a basic functionality of the room would be working with no problems. Electricity, working desk, window, door. Unfortunately a door handle from inside was broken in a way, that it still unlocks the locking mechanism, but it was not comfortable to hold using hands.

## Task: 
  Fix the door handle or find an alternative. 
## Action: 
### Approach one: find a replacement. 
  Initially I tried to find a replacement of that door handle. The broken part was just one part of the entire locking mechanism, but it had a unique shape that wouldn’t allow any other door handle from HomeDepot to be used instead. So I needed to find an original part. Unfortunately, the manufacturer of that lock mechanism was a manufacturer of the entire shed, and they were not selling just just parts of it. I couldn't find a that part in any online stores either, so I give up on approach one.
### Approach two: Fix the broken part I had. 
This looks simple - weld two pieces together. At the moment I didn’t have any welding equipment or experience(not like I have it now), and so I decided to find a place where I can find it. The solution was a place called TechShop(that place filed bankruptcy on 2/26/2018). It was a place like Hacker Dojo, but for a hardware. Woodshop, machine shop, any type of tools to work with metal. They had classes to teach people how to use power tools, welding machines, all kinds of stuff. Unfortunately, even though I just needed to weld two pieces of a part together myself I needed to first take a class, get certificate and only then I would get access to the tool. I honestly wouldn't mind to learn that skill, but those classes were out of my budget. So I asked if anybody else with a certificate can help me to weld it. One of the TechShop employee tried to help me, but failed. “Our welder can’t weld this metal” he told me, thou years later after watching the entire [MAN AT ARMS: REFORGED](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNKcMBYP_-18FLgk4BYGtfw), I think it was this guy just didn’t know how to weld properly. But anyway, at that moment I gave up on approach two as well.
### Approach three: find an alternative. 
At this moment I decided that it is a convenient moment to try build something smart with that door. I saw a friend of mine have tried to replace a locking mechanism on a door in his room with an electronic coil and I decided to do the same.

The idea is simple: a door latch is attached to a metal kernel inside a magnetic coil, pushed away with a spring. In a default state, the latch is extended by spring, locking the door. If you apply 12 volts to a coil, it will attract the coil inside of it, therefore the latch will be pushed inside, unlocking a door. The next part is even simpler - take of original mechanism, attach it to the door with few screws, attach a regular door handle to the door from outside. Oh, right, and create a mechanism to apply 12 volts to a coil everytime when I needed to open a door.

I bought a few simple buttons from [HSC](http://www.halted.com/), wired it in parallel to each other in a series to the coil and 12V power supply, wired one of the buttons outside the shed, another inside and here we are, having an electric door lock.

## Result: 
A functioning electric door lock, can be open using a button inside and outside the shed. I really didn’t like an idea of having a button outside the shed, since it was not very secure, so at this point I have been thinking of a ways to replace a button with some other interface. This idea led me to a lot of different solutions, that you can find by the links next.
